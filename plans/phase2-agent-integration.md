# Phase 2: CrewAI Integration and Agent Implementation

## Objectives
- Integrate CrewAI framework
- Implement ReAct-based Manager Agent
- Create task execution system

## Implementation Steps

### 1. CrewAI Setup and Integration (Week 4)
- Set up CrewAI environment:
  - Install and configure CrewAI
  - Define basic agent structure
  - Create task representation system
- Implement CrewAI interface layer:
  - Task assignment mechanism
  - Agent communication protocols
  - Schedule execution tracking

### 2. Manager Agent Implementation (Week 4-5)
- Develop ReAct-based Manager Agent:
  - Implement reasoning cycle
  - Create action space definition
  - Build observation handling
- Integrate with QUBO solver:
  - Create optimization trigger logic
  - Implement solution interpretation
  - Build schedule distribution mechanism

### 3. Worker Agent Implementation (Week 5)
- Create Worker Agent framework:
  - Task execution capabilities
  - Status reporting
  - Error handling
- Implement agent coordination:
  - Task handoff protocol
  - Progress monitoring
  - Conflict resolution

### 4. Testing and Validation (Week 6)
- Create agent behavior tests:
  - Manager Agent decision making
  - Worker Agent task execution
  - Inter-agent communication
- Implement system tests:
  - End-to-end workflow
  - Error handling scenarios
  - Performance benchmarks

## Dependencies
- CrewAI framework
- Phase 1 components (QUBO solver, Azure integration)
- (Optional) OpenAI API for LLM-based reasoning

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Manager Agent successfully triggers optimization
- [ ] Worker Agents execute assigned tasks correctly
- [ ] System handles basic error cases
- [ ] End-to-end tests pass for multi-agent scenarios

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: CrewAI API changes
  - Mitigation: Create abstraction layer
- Risk: Agent communication overhead
  - Mitigation: Implement efficient messaging
- Risk: Coordination failures
  - Mitigation: Robust error handling and recovery

## Next Phase Prerequisites
- Working multi-agent system
- Successful task execution
- Basic error handling implemented
