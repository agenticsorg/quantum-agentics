# Implementation Planning Log - February 15, 2025

## Task
Review 'README.md' and develop an implementation plan in /plans/ as md files.

## Actions Taken

1. Created initial implementation plans:
   - phase1-core-infrastructure.md: Core QUBO implementation and Azure integration (Weeks 1-3)
   - phase2-agent-integration.md: CrewAI integration and agent implementation (Weeks 4-6)
   - phase3-optimization-scaling.md: Scaling and performance optimization (Weeks 7-10)

2. Reviewed README.md for missing components and identified:
   - Need for ipywidgets UI coverage
   - Explicit planning for both QA and QAOA approaches
   - More detailed evaluation framework

3. Created additional plans:
   - phase4-ui-evaluation.md: UI development and evaluation framework (Weeks 11-14)
   - Updated master-implementation-plan.md to include all phases

## Implementation Plan Structure

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-3)
- Basic project structure
- QUBO formulation
- Azure Quantum integration
- Testing framework

### Phase 2: Agent Integration (Weeks 4-6)
- CrewAI integration
- Manager Agent implementation
- Worker Agent framework
- System testing

### Phase 3: Optimization & Scaling (Weeks 7-10)
- QUBO optimization
- Scaling strategies
- Performance enhancements
- Advanced features

### Phase 4: UI & Evaluation (Weeks 11-14)
- ipywidgets-based user interface
- Multi-solver integration (QA & QAOA)
- Evaluation framework
