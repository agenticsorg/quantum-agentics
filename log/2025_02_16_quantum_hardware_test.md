# Quantum Hardware Test Implementation

## Overview
Added a test script to verify and test quantum hardware access using Azure Quantum's IonQ QPU.

## Implementation Details

### Test Location
- Created `tests/scripts/test_quantum_hardware.py`

### Features
1. Real Quantum Hardware Testing
   - Configures IonQ QPU access
   - Implements Bell state preparation circuit
   - Handles quantum job submission and monitoring

2. Error Handling
   - Detects provider ID access issues
   - Provides clear upgrade instructions
   - Suggests simulator fallback option

3. User Guidance
   - Clear instructions for account upgrade
   - Link to Azure Quantum portal
   - Steps to request hardware access

### Error Messages
The test provides user-friendly messages for common scenarios:
```
Error: Unable to access quantum hardware.

Your account needs to be upgraded to access real quantum hardware:
1. Visit: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/quantum
2. Upgrade to a paid subscription
3. Request access to IonQ hardware

In the meantime, you can use 'ionq.simulator' for testing.
```

## Technical Details

### Circuit Implementation
```json
{
    "format": "ionq.circuit.v1",
    "body": {
        "qubits": 2,
        "circuit": [
            {"gate": "gpi2", "target": 0, "phase": 0},
            {"gate": "gpi2", "target": 1, "phase": 0},
            {"gate": "h", "target": 0},
            {"gate": "cnot", "control": 0, "target": 1},
            {"gate": "measure", "target": [0, 1]}
        ]
    }
}
```

### Key Features
- Extended timeout for hardware jobs (10 minutes)
- Temporary file handling for circuit submission
- Proper cleanup in all scenarios
- Comprehensive error detection

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding more test circuits
2. Implement performance benchmarking
3. Add comparison between hardware and simulator results
4. Create documentation for quantum hardware access setup
