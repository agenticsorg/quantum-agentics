# Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup

## Objectives
- Set up the basic project structure
- Implement core QUBO formulation
- Create Azure Quantum integration foundation

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Structure Setup (Week 1)
- Create the following directory structure:
```
QAM-Project/
├── qam/                        # Main package directory
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── scheduler.py           # QUBO formulation and solver
│   ├── crew_interface.py      # CrewAI integration
│   └── utils.py              # Utility functions
├── tests/                     # Test directory
├── scripts/                   # Automation scripts
└── docs/                     # Documentation
```

### 2. Core QUBO Implementation (Week 2)
- Implement QUBO formulation in `scheduler.py`:
  - Task-agent assignment variables
  - Constraint encoding (no overlaps, all tasks assigned)
  - Objective function (minimize makespan)
- Create utility functions for:
  - Problem instance generation
  - Solution validation
  - Schedule visualization

### 3. Azure Quantum Integration (Week 2-3)
- Implement Azure Quantum solver interface:
  - Authentication and workspace setup
  - Job submission pipeline
  - Result retrieval and parsing
- Create automation scripts for:
  - Environment setup
  - Job management
  - Result processing

### 4. Basic Testing Framework (Week 3)
- Implement unit tests for:
  - QUBO formulation correctness
  - Constraint validation
  - Solution parsing
- Create integration tests for:
  - Azure Quantum job submission
  - End-to-end small problem solving

## Dependencies
- Python 3.10+
- Azure Quantum SDK
- Azure CLI with quantum extension
- pytest for testing

## Success Criteria
- [ ] QUBO formulation correctly represents scheduling problem
- [ ] Azure Quantum jobs can be submitted and results retrieved
- [ ] Unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Small test problems (5 tasks, 2 agents) solved successfully

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Azure Quantum API changes
  - Mitigation: Abstract Azure interaction layer
- Risk: QUBO scaling issues
  - Mitigation: Start with small problems, implement size checks

## Next Phase Prerequisites
- Successful QUBO problem solving
- Azure Quantum integration working
- Basic test framework in place
