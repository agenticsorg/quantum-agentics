# QAM Agent Implementation Log - February 15, 2025

## Overview
Implemented QAM Agent with ReACT methodology and quantum scheduling capabilities, integrating crewai reasoning with OpenRouter and QAM modules.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Quantum Tools Integration
- Implemented `QAMTools` class with:
  - Task dependency analysis
  - Resource requirement analysis
  - QAOA parameter optimization
  - Quantum schedule generation
  - Resource allocation optimization
  - Solution validation

### 2. ReACT Integration
- Integrated crewai reasoning with OpenRouter
- Implemented structured ReACT methodology:
  - Thought: Analysis phase
  - Action: Implementation steps
  - Observation: Results tracking
  - Reflection: Evaluation phase

### 3. Resource Management
- Implemented resource tracking per time slot
- Added capacity constraint validation
- Resource utilization optimization

### 4. Validation System
- Dependency constraint checking
- Resource capacity validation
- Schedule completeness verification

## Test Results

### Sample Problem
```python
sample_tasks = [
    {
        "id": "task0",
        "name": "Quantum Circuit Optimization",
        "duration": 3,
        "resources": ["quantum_processor", "memory"],
        "dependencies": []
    },
    {
        "id": "task1",
        "name": "Classical Pre-processing",
        "duration": 2,
        "resources": ["cpu", "memory"],
        "dependencies": ["task0"]
    },
    {
        "id": "task2",
        "name": "Result Analysis",
        "duration": 2,
        "resources": ["cpu", "memory"],
        "dependencies": ["task1"]
    }
]
```

### Resource Configuration
```python
resources = {
    "quantum_processor": {"capacity": 2, "cost_per_unit": 10},
    "cpu": {"capacity": 4, "cost_per_unit": 1},
    "memory": {"capacity": 8, "cost_per_unit": 2}
}
```

### Validation Results
- ✅ All Tasks Scheduled
- ✅ Dependencies Satisfied
- ✅ Resources Valid
