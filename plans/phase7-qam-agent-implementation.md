# Phase 7: QAM Agent Implementation

## Overview
This phase focuses on implementing a new QAM Agent that integrates with the Quantum Agent Manager (QAM) system. The agent leverages modules from the existing `qam/` package (such as cluster management, scheduling, quantum reasoning, Azure Quantum integration, and orchestration protocols) to perform task scheduling and decision-making. The implementation supports configurable arguments, evaluation options, and includes comprehensive unit tests and execution examples.

## Objectives
1. **Create Project Structure:**
   - New folder: `agents/qam_agent/`
   - Subfolders: `examples/` and `tests/` within `agents/qam_agent/`
2. **Agent Implementation:**
   - Implement `agent.py` defining a `QAMAgent` class that:
     - Reads configuration settings (from a JSON file or defaults).
     - Integrates with QAM modules (e.g., scheduler, quantum_reasoning).
     - Processes specified arguments and settings.
     - Provides evaluation options such as performance and decision quality.
3. **Example Script:**
   - Create `agents/qam_agent/examples/example_agent_run.py` to demonstrate agent execution.
4. **Unit Testing:**
   - Create `agents/qam_agent/tests/test_agent.py` with sample data to:
     - Instantiate the agent with sample configuration.
     - Verify that the agent returns the expected list of decisions.
     - Run each test individually until all tests pass.
5. **Planning Update:**
   - Update project plans with a new phase file (this document) to reflect the phased integration of the QAM Agent into the overall system.

## Implementation Details

### Agent Functionality
- **Configuration:**  
  The agent reads its configuration from a JSON file (if provided) or uses default settings. Configurable parameters include:
  - `agent_name`
  - `mode` (e.g., "test", "demo", "unittest")
  - `settings` (arguments, evaluation options like performance metrics, decision quality, resource utilization, etc.)

- **Integration:**  
  The agent imports and uses modules from the `qam/` package (e.g., `scheduler`, `quantum_reasoning`, `cluster_management`, `azure_quantum`, and `orchestration_protocol`) to simulate scheduling tasks and making decisions.

- **Execution:**  
  The `run()` method of the agent simulates the scheduling process by generating a series of dummy decisions, which are then printed and saved to an output file.

### Testing and Example
- **Unit Tests:**  
  Tests in `agents/qam_agent/tests/test_agent.py` will:
  - Validate proper initialization of the agent.
  - Verify that calling `run()` returns a list of decisions.
  - Use sample configuration data for testing.

- **Example Execution:**  
  An example script in `agents/qam_agent/examples/example_agent_run.py` demonstrates how to run the agent, showing sample output and decision logging.

## Expected Outcomes
- A new, fully functional QAM Agent integrated into the project structure.
- A complete test suite (with sample data) to validate the agent's behavior.
- An example script that runs the agent and outputs sample decisions.
- Updated project planning documentation reflecting this new phase of implementation.

## Next Steps
1. Finalize the agent implementation in `agents/qam_agent/agent.py`.
2. Run unit tests in `agents/qam_agent/tests/` one at a time until all tests pass.
3. Execute the example in `agents/qam_agent/examples/` and evaluate its output.
4. Refine evaluation options and update configuration settings as needed.
5. Incorporate feedback and update overall phase planning documentation accordingly.
