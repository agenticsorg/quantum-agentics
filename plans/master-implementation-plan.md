- QUBO formulation
- Azure Quantum integration
- Testing framework

### Phase 2: Agent Integration (Weeks 4-6)
- CrewAI integration
- Manager Agent implementation
- Worker Agent framework
- System testing

### Phase 3: Optimization & Scaling (Weeks 7-10)
- QUBO optimization
- Scaling strategies
- Performance enhancements
- Advanced features

### Phase 4: UI & Evaluation (Weeks 11-14)
- ipywidgets-based user interface
- Multi-solver integration (QA & QAOA)
- Evaluation framework
- Analysis and visualization tools

## Timeline
