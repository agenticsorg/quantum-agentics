# Phase 5: Quantum ReACT Implementation Plan

## Overview
This phase introduces quantum-inspired reasoning capabilities to the agent system through the Quantum ReACT (Reasoning, Action, and Corrective Thinking) approach.

## Core Components

### 1. Quantum Reasoning Module (qam/quantum_reasoning.py)
```python
class QuantumReasoningState:
    """Represents the quantum state of agent reasoning."""
    # Maintains probability amplitudes for different decision paths
    # Supports superposition of multiple reasoning states

class QuantumReACT:
    """Core reasoning engine using quantum-inspired algorithms."""
    # Implements quantum-inspired decision making
    # Manages reasoning loops and state evolution
```

### 2. Agent Enhancement (qam/crew_interface.py)
Extend the existing Agent class to include quantum reasoning capabilities:
```python
class EnhancedAgent(Agent):
    """Agent with quantum reasoning capabilities."""
    reasoning_state: QuantumReasoningState
    decision_history: List[DecisionPoint]
```

### 3. Integration Points

#### A. Scheduler Integration
Extend QUBOScheduler to incorporate reasoning feedback:
```python
class QUBOScheduler:
    def build_qubo_with_reasoning(self, horizon: int, 
                                 reasoning_state: QuantumReasoningState) -> List[QUBOTerm]:
        # Incorporate reasoning state into QUBO formulation
        # Adjust weights based on previous decisions
```

#### B. Manager Agent Enhancement
Extend QAMManagerAgent to support reasoning capabilities:
```python
class QAMManagerAgent:
    def optimize_schedule_with_reasoning(self) -> Dict:
        # Include reasoning state in optimization
        # Update agent decision paths based on outcomes
```

        self.history = []     # Previous states
        
    def evolve(self, hamiltonian: np.ndarray):
        # Apply quantum-inspired evolution
        pass
        
    def measure(self) -> DecisionPath:
        # Collapse state to specific decision
        pass
```

### Decision Making Process
```python
class QuantumReACT:
    def make_decision(self, context: Dict, 
                     state: QuantumReasoningState) -> Decision:
        # Generate superposition of possible decisions
        # Evolve state based on context
        # Measure to get concrete decision
        pass
        
    def reflect_and_adjust(self, outcome: Outcome,
                          state: QuantumReasoningState):
        # Update reasoning based on outcome
        # Adjust future decision weights
        pass
```

### Integration with Existing Code
1. Scheduler Integration:
   ```python
   class QUBOScheduler:
       def _build_reasoning_terms(self, 
                                state: QuantumReasoningState) -> List[QUBOTerm]:
           # Add terms based on reasoning state
           pass
   ```

2. Agent Integration:
   ```python
   class Agent:
       def execute_task_with_reasoning(self, task: Task):
           # Use quantum reasoning for execution
           # Update state based on outcome
           pass
   ```
